# scrupal-core
This is the core (most fundamental) module of Scrupal, a reactive content management system and
web framework based on Play Framework. It provides a content management system based on asynchronous processing,
non-blocking I/O, the actor model, publish and subscribe events and with sufficient hooks and modularity for extension
via Guice modules.
